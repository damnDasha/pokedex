// Observables are kind of like promises, but better because:
// they are declarative; computation does not start until subscription.
// Promises execute immediately on creation.
// This makes observables useful for defining recipes that can be run whenever you need the result.

// Observables provide many values.
// Promises provide one.
// This makes observables useful for getting multiple values over time.

//Observables differentiate between chaining and subscription.
// Promises only have .then() clauses.
// This makes observables useful for creating complex transformation recipes to be used by other part of the system,
// without causing the work to be executed.

//Observables subscribe() is responsible for handling errors.
// Promises push errors to the child promises.
// This makes observables useful for centralized and predictable error handling.
